# Malinois For You

![The introduction page for Malinois For You, with the navigation bar visible and a malinois walking towards the camera](assets/images/malinois-introduction-page.jpg)

The Malinois is one of the most curated dog breeds in the world. Many people might be tempted to adopt this dog without knowing about their needs and demands. To help making that choice, this website ist designed to give information about the character, training requirements and other traits. After reading through the site, users should be able to make an educated decision if they want to adopt a dog of this breed. It is also meant to raise awareness about current activities of Malinois in service or in official dog sport competitions by offering a newsletter.
The title of the website has been shortened on purpose to better fit on smaller devices and to be more memorable. A very long title would also not fit with the scope of the project; detailed information like body measurements or breed lineages is not included.

## Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is featured on every page and allows the user to easily find the topic he needs more information for. It collapses on smaller screens and can be accessed through the button that appears.

### Newsletter

![The newsletter form for subscribing. Contains the only pun in the project.](assets/images/malinois-newsletter.jpg)

Users can subscribe to the newsletter by inputting their name and email address; upon submitting, they are redirected through a thank-you-page back to the landing page.

### Colors

Three colors were used in the project: lightyellow, lightskyblue and black for the text. The colors contrast each other nicely without making it difficult to read or distracting from the content. They also don't strain the eyes.

## General Page Structure

The content ist structured straight from top to bottom for easy readability; two pictures are included on every page in roughly the same location.
This helps the reader follow the page layout easily and is planned to make them visit every page to see all pictures - including visiting the newsletter, which most people would otherwise not be interested in. 

### Landing Page

The landing page gives a short introduction to the breed and the purpose of the website. The goal is to make the user look through all the pages if he is curious about the breed and is considering adopting.

### Footer

Contains links to the social media of the website owner, who posts stories and pictures of Malinois. For anyone who wants more Malinois content and isn't interested in/ satisfied by the newsletter.

### History Page

A short page to give some context to the origins of the breed and how they came to be as they are now. As most casual viewers won't be gripped by the content, the pictures were chosen for levity and making the user continue visiting the site to see if there are more humorous pictures.

### Appearance

Since the Malinois looks very similar to several other western european shepherd dogs - mainly the German Shepherd Dog - this page gives a desciption of their looks so a layman can indentify them. The first picture shows several Malinois at different ages to show the physical development; the second image has a Malinois next to a German Shepherd to highlight their differences.

### Character Page

The character page gives a description of the personality of the breed and the resulting behaviour. As the temper of a Malinois is often underestimated, a particularly threatening picture was chosen for the top. However, the picture at the bottom was included to prevent users from thinking the Malinois is a purely dangerous dog.

### Training Page

The training page gives information about the necessary amount of training and the kinds of training the breed is suited for. Since the breed has high demands concerning physical activities, several good training methods are mentioned along with the dietary needs. Also, most people have seen dogs perform in Agility Sport before, but a dog carrying a dumbbell is a rare sight. That picture is included to once again remind of the capabilities of these dogs.

### Newsletter

Anyone wanting up-to-date information on the breed can subscribe to the newsletter to get noteworthy news about Malinois, like tournament performances or great achievements of working dogs. This is designed to allow people to keep getting information on the breed without having to actively search for it. The puppy pictures were chosen as a reward for those who went through the whole page and brighten their mood; also to make them associate the newsletter with the puppies. And one of the things people can't get enough of are puppies or pictures of them.
